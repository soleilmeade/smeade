<h2>My Story</h2>
<p> I started my journey into the creative world at a young age but wasn't quite aware of what to do with my love for crafting, coloring, and drawing. It wasn't until my senior year in college that I stumbled upon Graphic Design and I've been captivated since. After completing my degree from Carlow University in Business/Communications and landing an undesirable job, I decided to pursue Graphic Design. I attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh and obtained a Digital Design Diploma. It was there that I was introduced to coding but ultimately was intrigued by graphic design. Upon graduating I continued to hone my skill doing free work for friends until finally in 2013 I launched my own business Soleil Branding Essentials. I am responsible for the brands of many small businesses and non profits in the Pittsburgh area and continue to grow my clientele. Many of my clients would ask for website and I would be reminded of when coding made me cry during my time at the Art Institute but one of my  2019 goals was to give it a try again to add to the service offering. I attended a beginners course hosted by Upstream Coding which was an assuring and informative session. The staff there encouraged my skill and invited me to join their 6 week cohort into coding. Those 6 weeks I learned so much and realized that I didn't have to cry but could conquer coding with time and dedication. Now I am currently working as a fellow at Upstream Coding continuing to grow in my craft and dream into how instrumental this skill will be to my current business. </p>
